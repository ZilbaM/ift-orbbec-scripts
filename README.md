# IFT : Orbbec Femto Bolt Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of custom Python scripts designed to interface with the Orbbec Femto Bolt 3D camera using the pyorbbecsdk library. These scripts have been developed for and by the Institute of Future Technology (IFT) to facilitate various 3D scanning and imaging projects, enhancing research and development within the institute.

## Context

The Orbbec Femto Bolt is a high-precision 3D camera that provides unparalleled depth sensing capabilities. Its application ranges from 3D modeling and spatial analysis to interactive installations and advanced research projects. The pyorbbecsdk library offers a Pythonic interface to the camera's SDK, allowing for easy integration into research workflows and custom applications developed at IFT.

## Installation

You can refer to [this tutorial](https://dvic.devinci.fr/technological-expedition/how-to-use-orbbec-femto-bolt-3d-camera) to help with installing and using the `pyorbbecsdk` library.
